            <p>
                Hi! I'm Sanketh, I have hands-on experience in managing digital content for the IEEE tech club and its branches at national level. My journey includes curating posts, designing campaigns for events, conferences, promotional events and contributing to the IEEE newsletter, where I honed my skills in quick design thinking and creative content making. The interesting part? Many of these posters were created within a span of one hour!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to join the social media team at the Daniels School to gain international exposure and push my creative boundaries. The business school is launching new courses and initiatives, and I look forward to the challenge of covering these developments and engaging a diverse audience with hooks.
